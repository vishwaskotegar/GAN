## Overview
FashionGAN is designed to generate fashion images using a Generative Adversarial Network. The project includes defining a generator and discriminator, training the models on a fashion dataset, and saving/loading the trained models.

## Requirements
To run the notebook, you need the following libraries and dependencies:
- Python 3.10
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- PIL (Python Imaging Library)
- SciPy

You can install the required libraries using pip:
```bash
pip install tensorflow=2.10 numpy matplotlib pillow scipy
```

## Usage
1. Clone the repository or download the `FashionGAN.ipynb` notebook.
2. Ensure you have the required dependencies installed.
3. Open the notebook in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
4. Follow the steps in the notebook to preprocess data, define models, train, and evaluate.

## Notebook Structure
The notebook is structured as follows:
1. **Imports**: Import necessary libraries.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Load and preprocess the fashion dataset.
3. **Model Definition**: Define the architecture of the generator and discriminator.
4. **Training**: Train the GAN model using the preprocessed dataset.
5. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the model's performance and generate samples.
6. **Saving and Loading Models**: Save and load the trained generator and discriminator models.

### Sections in Detail
- **Data Preprocessing**:
  - Loading and normalizing the dataset.
  - Visualizing sample images from the dataset.
- **Model Definition**:
  - Defining the generator model to create fashion images.
  - Defining the discriminator model to distinguish between real and generated images.
- **Training**:
  - Setting up the training loop.
  - Visualizing the training process and generated images at different epochs.
- **Evaluation**:
  - Generating new fashion images using the trained generator.
  - Visualizing the generated images.
- **Saving and Loading Models**:
  - Saving the trained models to disk.
  - Loading the saved models for inference or further training.

## Results
The results of the training process, including generated images and model evaluation metrics, can be found within the notebook. Sample generated images are displayed to demonstrate the performance of the GAN.
